    Sister PR: <https://github.com/CuBoulder/ucb_bootstrap_layouts/pull/57>

* * *

-   ### Adds the Faculty Publications block

    [new] This update adds the Faculty Publications block. Faculty Publications blocks pull results from [CU Experts](https://experts.colorado.edu/). A variety of filters are available to bring near feature-parity with the version in D7. Notable changes in this version:

    -   Adds an option to detect when the block has been added to a faculty member's person page, and automatically use that person's email address for the author filter.
    -   Replaces the pager with a "More publications" button which loads the next batch of publications. Results are loaded fast and no longer require a reload of the page to view.
    -   Removes "Any" for number of results to prevent poor client performance. 10, 25, 50, or 100 are available options.

    Slider Ultrawide (1600x600)
    Slider Widescreen (1600:900)
    Slider 3:2 (1500:1000)

    Each style has the proper sizing dictated by Kevin
    The Slider block has been updated to have the proper names and sizes associated with them.
    The slide paragraph now has the default image style set to Original.
    The slider block template has had it's sizing logic moved to the paragraph slide template.
    The paragraph slide template uses parent logic to check what side the slider is going to be and applies the appropriate style to each image.
